# Website for the Brunonian Chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi Society.

The Alpha Delta Phi Society is a diverse, gender-inclusive community of friends that encourage
each other's passions and have lots of fun along the way. Whether you find us hanging
out in the lounge, singing in the pine room, playing video games in the TV room, or
baking in the kitchen, you can expect excellent company, meaningful conversation,
and boundless shennanigans. We celebrate our Society's rich history and traditions, but most
importantly, we care deeply for one another and develop lifelong friendships. If the
Alpha Delta Phi Society sounds like a place you'd like to call home, stop by
anytime—we'd love to meet you!

This codebase has been created and maintained by web chairs of the Bruononian Alpha Delta Phi Society.

A simple (gradient-heavy) single pager that revisits a style I messed with on two
previous designs (Tessellate and Telephasic). Fully responsive, built on Sass,
and, as usual, loaded with an assortment of pre-styled elements. Have fun! :)
